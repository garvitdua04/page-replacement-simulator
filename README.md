# Page Replacement Simulator

This Python program compares three page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, and Optimal. It simulates each algorithm on several reference string patterns (including random patterns using Python's `random` module), prints step-by-step results, and generates performance charts. The program also checks for Beladyâ€™s anomaly.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required library:


pip install matplotlib

3. Run the program:
python page_replacement_algos.py


The script will print results in the terminal and save charts as PNG files in the same folder.
